  ## Summary of Findings
  <Show the variations studied in a table>

  Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does.  The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.

  # Figures

  ## Fig. 1: Single Parameter Variation

Shows two plots in which both measure height for varying flight path angle(gamma) and velocity values. The top graph shows three different gamma values with their corresponding heights. The bottom graph shows three different velocities and their corresponding heights. Nominal trajectory for velocity is 3.55m/s while the nominal trajectory for initial flight path angle is -0.18rad

  <The above plot should also show the nominal trajectory>

  Figure 2 shows two graphs in which 100 random iterations within an expected range were considered. The first graph on the left shows those 100 iterations graphed by height vs. range. The second graph to the right shows two curve fit plots of time vs. range and time vs. height.
